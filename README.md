Pylasu is an AST Library in the [StarLasu](https://github.com/Strumenta/StarLasu) family, targeting the Python language. [Documentation](https://pylasu.readthedocs.io) is on Read the Docs.

## Testing

```shell
python -m unittest discover tests 
```

## Linting

```shell
flake8 . && flake8 tests
```

## Packaging and distributing

Update version in pyproject.toml, setup.cfg and setup.py _(TODO do we need all three?)_, then run:

```shell
rm dist/*
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

If all goes well, tag the release:

```shell
git tag 
```

### Extracting Documentation

Here's how to extract the documentation into HTML using Sphinx, the most popular documentation generator for Python.

First, ensure you have Sphinx and the chosen theme installed:
```shell
pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```

Then, extract the documentation from the source code:
```shell
sphinx-apidoc -o docs pylasu
```

Finally, change into the docs directory and launch the build process:
```shell
cd docs
make html
```

If everything goes as it should, in `docs/_build/html` you'll find the generated documentation.
